# frappe installation
<strong>Introduction:</strong>

  Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

<strong>Get Started</strong>

  The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

<strong>Pre Requisites:</strong>

  Before you can start with Frappe, be sure you understand the stack it's built on.

<strong>Installation:</strong>

  Before you can use Frappe, you need to install it. We have a complete installation guide which covers all possibilities, this guide will also help you understand the backend stack.
