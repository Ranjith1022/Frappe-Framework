#Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database.
#It is the framework which powers ERPNext. It is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.
#The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data and is used to build front-ends very easily.
#We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application.
#It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.
